CHAPTER 5 - RELIGION

Arek climbed into the spacious carriage and they left for the Academy and the Priest stared to explain. the belief system of their civilization.
As the mythology went, Humanity had forsaken their faith, so God Yama decided to destroy humanity. But his son God Buddha pleaded with his father that some humans could still be saved, as it would be shameful to destroy the most perfect beings ever created. God Buddha reincarnates on Earth as a human being, Christ, to change the ways of humanity. Christ's story is long and full of suffering in his quest to save humanity. A small minority changed their ways and he gained 13 dedicated followers who were called Apostles. One of those 13 Apostles betrayed him which resulted in Christ's tortuous execution. The traitor committed suicide when he understood what he had done and Christ resurrected as God Buddha Christ.
God Buddha Christ had failed to put humanity on a correct path, so he took his 12 remaining Apostles while Source Earth was being destroyed and came to this planet name Newaz. Those that changed their ways on Source Earth after Buddha's teachings would be reincarnated into one of the Apostles' descendants, the rest of humanity was destroyed in body and soul without a chance to reincarnate.
The Yin and Yang symbol represent the relationship between humanity and both Gods.
God Yama, the white Yin, seem to give up on humanity and would not hesitate to punish those that stray, sometimes even tempting them to follow the wrong path. He surrounded humanity with dangerous beasts whose sole purpose is to kill human beings. But he still let his son go to Earth and save a small portion of humanity, he even created the planet Newaz for the surviving humans Even the beasts, while being a threat to humanity, also represented a path to divinity.
God Buddha Christ, the black Yang, believes in humanity and act as its champion, he gifted it the magic of technology and protects it, but his failure on Earth left a scar on his heart. If humanity's faith was ever to weaken, Buddha Christ would depart and the last humans would quickly perish.


God Yama and God Buddha Christ made a deal, any human that died without his sins repented will reincarnated as a lowly beast. It is why it is important for everyone to confess their sins regularly so they can be reincarnated as a human being. If their sins are grave and they confess, they might have a life of suffering as mortal human, but by living righteously in that new life, it would be followed by a better one as a cultivator.
[talk] Priest Reman: "The fact that we are cultivators shows that in our previous life we had been good, hard working people, faithful to God Buddha Christ. Those who remain mortal were sinners who repented in their past lives and must work honest lives dedicated to Buddha Christ so they could be Cultivators in their next lives. Cultivator geniuses were Apostles or heroes in their past lives, who sacrificed themselves defending humanity in the name of God Buddha Christ."
[talk] Arek: "Thank you for your enlightenment, I will dedicate myself to God Buddha Christ"
[think] Arek: "Amazing, this religion is perfectly conceived to control the population. The leader cannot be questioned as he not just a representative of a God, but an actual living deity who is the only protection humanity has against extinction. People sin and make mistakes, but as long as they confess, they will have another chance in their next lives to redeem themselves; no conspiracy against the leadership is possible. Also, everybody will do their best to contribute to society without complaints regardless of their conditions because they can only blame their previous lives for their misery and will willingly suffer for a better one after this life. Their lives are meant as a foundation for their next lives and as such their ambitions can be limited"
Arek admired whoever created this religion for devising such a perfect tool to control the population. As Arek as listening to more theology, a voice was heard from outside
[talk] Voice: "In the name of God Buddha Christ, please help me!"

***
[talk] Buddha: "Describe the attackers."
[talk] Pope: "They were a powerful Orcish army led by a Lord."
[talk] Buddha: "How did they reach the school?"
[talk] Pope: "They first stormed onto the shores and surrounded Chatagena, attacking it from all sides."
[talk] Buddha: "Of course, the attack failed, and one of the retreating groups attacked the school?"
[talk] Pope: "Yes, it's hard to imagine Chatagena falling. The attackers were defeated, and the survivors fled in all directions. We're still hunting down remnants of their forces. Unfortunately, a small group led by their Lord stumbled upon the school and kidnapped some students."
[talk] Buddha: "Then they fled towards the coast?"
[talk] Pope: "Your wisdom is infinite. They did indeed flee to the coast, but thanks to our moles, Apostle Kaba intercepted them before they reached the coast, and we were able to rescue some students."
[talk] Buddha: "Check where they were headed. You should find multiple underwater gateways."
[talk] Pope: "You mean?"
[talk] Buddha: "Their goal was never to take Chatagena. It was always the students."
[talk] Pope: "But their army was decimated!"
[talk] Buddha: "A small price to pay for capturing some technomancers, especially if one of them awakens."
[talk] Pope: "How could they know?"
[talk] Buddha: "They have spies among us. We were lucky that they didn't know about the moles, or they would have succeeded. How are the students’?”
[talk] Pope: "Most of them survived. It seems the orcs valued them more than regular slaves."
[talk] Buddha: "What do the student know?"
[talk] Pope: "We haven't answered any of their questions, so they're just speculating about what this world is. But they do know that this is not Source Earth. One of the students even awakened."
[talk] Buddha: "While in your custody?"
[talk] Pope: "Yes, we isolated him immediately."
[talk] Buddha: "Why didn't you terminate him?"
[talk] Pope: "I felt that this decision should come from you."
[talk] Buddha: "An immortal technomancer is too dangerous. Use any means necessary to extinguish this threat immediately. This experiment is over, and all evidence must be disposed of. Kill them all."
[talk] Pope: "Some of them could become exceptional scientists.”
[talk] Buddha: "If the orcs know, they probably heard some information as well. If they ever confirm what we did, our empire would be at risk. We must bury all the evidence. What about the Lord?”
[talk] Pope: "The Lord escaped."
[talk] Buddha: "A powerful Orc must be pulling the strings from the shadows, powerful enough to have discovered the existence of the school and organize an elaborate abduction operation led by a Lord. Try to capture that Lord alive. It must have valuable information."
[talk] Pope: "Prince Tameran is in pursuit, so it should be captured soon. They must believe they can enslave humans as they do with goblins."
[talk] Buddha: "Have all the students been accounted for?"
[talk] Pope: "We purged the entire school soon after the attack began and identified all remains except for one student whom a mole guided to an escape shaft. He couldn't open the shaft, and his ashes are spread throughout the forest."
[talk] Buddha: "Why would a mole help a student escape?"
[talk] Pope: "It seems this student was particularly gifted, a one in a million scientist. The mole felt that this kind of talent needed to be saved."
[talk] Buddha: "How old was he?"
[talk] Pope: "13."
[talk] Buddha: "He was of age to awaken? Does nobody understand the threat this boy represents?"
[talk] Pope: "He is dead."
[talk] Buddha: "You have lived too many lives and too long to make that kind of assumption. Without proof, always assume the worst: Assume that student survived and became an awakened technomancer.”

***
The carriage came to a halt in the forest, where a man was kneeling ahead of them. Two of the guards approached him with raised swords while the other guards kept their guns aimed at the man. The man was visibly upset and was trying to speak with the guards, but they remained unresponsive.
[talk] Priest Reman: "It seems this man has escaped from an attack. I need to perform a confession. Stay in the carriage and follow any instructions I send you."
The Priest, who was experienced, tagged both Arek and Mari before leaving the carriage. As soon as Arek was tagged, he was able to see the Priest's power level.
[think] Arek: "He feels much more powerful than Mari, on par with the beast pulling the carriage, but less powerful than the driver."
[talk] Arek: "The priest mentioned something about Realms. What are these?"
[talk] Mari: "We're in the Awakened realm right now. The next realm is Devil, which is the lowest realm for beasts."
[talk] Arek: "How many Realms are there?"
[talk] Mari: "I know of Mortal, Awakened, Devil, Knight, Sage, Lord, Prince, Monarch and Saint.”
[talk] Arek: "Do you know what Realm the Priest and the driver are?"
[talk] Mari: "Priest Reman is a Knight. The driver is probably a Devil."
[think] Arek: "I think I understand the Realms now. It's related to the feeling of power. The Priest is two Realms above me and Mari. The Ankylosaurus is at the same Realm as the Priest, and the driver is one Realm above, so he should be a Sage."
[talk] Arek: "How do you know the realm of Priest Reman?"
[talk] Mari: "Their title corresponds to their Realm: Deacons are Devils, Priests are Knights, Bishops are Sages, Archbishops are Lords, Cardinals are Princes, the Pope is a Monarch, and the apostles are Saints”
[talk] Arek: "How do you know the driver is a Devil?"
[talk] Mari: "It's very hard to ascend to a higher realm. Why would anyone above a Devil be a mere driver?"
[talk] Arek: "So you can't feel his realm?"
[talk] Mari: "You can only sense the realms of those who are equal or lower than yourself. If you're of a lower realm, you only know they're stronger, but not how much stronger, unless they release their aura."
[talk] Arek: “Aren’t there abilities that can do that?”
[think] Arek: “Like the one the dinosaur used”
[talk] Mari: “There are, but they are not reliable on higher realms so you would only know they are stronger.”

Chapter 16 - NO WAY BACK

***
[talk] Pope: “The God’s brother was a Scientist who had awakened, possessing a crippled middle dantian. The God must have manipulated many minds to conceal him so adeptly within the academy."
[talk] Buddha: “Was he among those that fled to distant lands?”
[talk] Pope: "Yes, he ventured far into the remote wilds, along with two others. Now, only the deity remains with us."
[talk] Buddha: "Why would this deity tether itself to such a far-flung and wild place, and by what means?"
[talk] Pope: "If it becomes known that we lost an Immortal Scientist to the vast wilderness, the consequences would be dire for us."
[talk] Buddha: "With their deity captured, the trio would be defenseless. It's best they remain undiscovered and just perish.”
[talk] Pope: “For a deity to seal itself within a Chosen, sacrificing its memories, and furthermore, to employ an immortal scientist - it implies a complex agenda”
[talk] Buddha: "Considering you're a reincarnated deity, why would you opt for reincarnation over becoming a Chosen?"
[talk] Pope: "When a deity selects a Chosen, once that Chosen achieves Saint status, the deity's consciousness within is erased, only to enter reincarnation devoid of memories. Direct reincarnation, on the other hand, offers preserved memories and control across lives, which, despite limited powers, can be invaluable."
[talk] Buddha: "Why might a deity sacrifice its very essence for a Chosen?"
[talk] Pope: "In the vast expanse of eternity, and amidst lifetimes, I've considered choosing a Chosen to helm the Goblins. Even if it meant reincarnating devoid of my memories, it wouldn't signify a true conclusion. There are deities who might see the allure in relinquishing memories, readily sacrificing for a virtuous purpose or to redress old transgressions. Had the boy kept his powers concealed, the deity could've subtly manipulated events beneath our gaze, eventually positioning itself to overthrow us and reign supreme over our domain, such is the potency of a Chosen.
[talk] Buddha: "Have humans ever ascended to godhood?"
[talk] Pope: "Humanity is in its nascent phase. But, fueled by either reverence or malice, a non-human deity might choose to empower them."
[talk] Buddha: “The humans under our protection weren't the sole survivors. Whatever intentions they hold for the humans, it's peculiar for a deity to target our seemingly inconsequential empire. Unless, of course, it's because it's governed by me and another reincarnated deity with the capacity to identify them.”
[talk] Pope: "Could this be a retributive act from a Beast God?"
[talk] Buddha: “Vengeance for what? We ran away and hid leaving other to fight. Any vengeance from a God would be directed at those who fight to expand, not at us.”
[talk] Pope: "What other rationale stands?"
[talk] Buddha: "This Chosen may be a bargaining piece. The deity might aim for a potential alliance or trade."
[talk] Pope: "Would anyone stake so much on mere conjecture?"
[talk] Buddha: "Clearly someone who knows my kind well. We value resolution through trade, which explains my dealings with humans rather than their outright destruction. Yet, to propose a truly enticing deal, the right leverage is crucial. It demands not only exerting the correct pressure but also possessing something truly unique to put on the table. Such endeavors require powers beyond what you wield."
[talk] Pope: "This deity's knowledge of us seems profound. Could it be aiding those who condemned us to this mortal realm?"
[talk] Buddha: “Are there any other choices presented to Gods?”
[talk] Pope: "There remains one ultimate path – the grandest of sacrifices. Upon birth, a child is imbued with heavenly powers, yet the bestowing deity vanishes from existence, breaking its own cycle of reincarnation.”
[talk] Buddha: "What nature does this heavenly power have?”
[talk] Pope: “I don’t know. As deities, we recognize the choice but its details remain enigmatic. It's a suicidal move likely never embarked upon."

Upon teleporting, the change in surroundings was starkly apparent. 
They were unmistakably no longer in there city or within the confines of the dense forest surrounding it. Instead of towering trees with a thick canopy that habitually obscured the heavens, they now found themselves amidst trees that were modest in height and less densely leafed.
The thick canopy was absent, leaving the vast expanse of the sky as the dominant feature above. This grey, wind-stirred sky lacked a discernible source of light, casting the area in an ambient, muted glow due to the overcast conditions.
Below, the once moss-covered ground was now graced with ankle-high grass, making their every step felt more grounded and tangible. The stark change in their surroundings left them both with a sense of wonder and caution.
Arek seized Rin’s hand.
Arek [talk]: “Tag her at the first opportunity.”
Rin [talk]: “I am no match for her.”
Arek [talk]: “Trust me.”
Bay's eyes darted around, puzzlement evident in her gaze.
Bay [talk]: “How?”
Arek [talk]: “Answer my questions and I'll ensure you get back safely.”
Bay regained her composure, flashing her trademark smile.
Bay [talk]: “Returning matters little if it means ending you.”
Both Rin and Bay charged towards each other with fierce determination. But just as they were about to clash, Bay vanished from her path, reappearing instantly in front of Arek with her dual swords raised, ready to strike.
Bay [talk]: “This isn’t about you. One life weighed against humanity’s fate is inconsequential.”
The blades halted abruptly, leaving only superficial cuts on either side of Arek's neck rather than decapitating him. Their abrupt stoppage was neither due to Arek's inherent resilience nor any hesitation from Bay. Instead, the very instant they touched his skin, Arek drained them of their Ki. Devoid of Ki, these swords stood no chance against the constitution of an immortal.
In executing this maneuver, Arek had devoted all his concentration. As fate would have it, at that precise moment, Sopi found himself in peril. Distracted, Arek couldn't prevent Sopi from teleporting directly back to him.
Bay, taken aback by the sudden draining of Ki from her sword, was momentarily distracted. Seizing this moment and fearing for Arek's safety, Rin delivered a powerful blow from behind. Ensuring she tagged Bay, Rin's forceful strike sent her crashing into the ground.
Arek stood in daze looking at Sopi, ignoring Bay and Rin 
While Sopi had remained phased and concealed, he hadn’t been entirely invisible to all eyes. The Barbarian, appearing deep in meditation, could actually observe Sopi. Consistently monitoring Arek's condition, Sopi exhibited a subtle reaction when he witnessed Bay's violent assault. Seized upon it, the Barbarian sprang into action against Sopi. On instinct, Sopi immediately teleported back to Arek's side. Caught in the midst of managing Bay's attack, Arek was unable to prevent Sopi's abrupt return.
Following Arek’s command, Sopi shot at Bay and Rin to tag them both.
In an instant, Bay surged to her feet and lunged at Rin with a swift sword strike, yet the attack proved futile as her Ki drained away. To exacerbate matters, her internal Ki and chakra destabilized, compelling her to collapse onto her knees.
Arek's [talk]  "Don’t you understand you are powerless in front of me?”


With Sopi's teleportation, the consequences reverberated profoundly; each spell it was maintaining was rendered null and void. This abrupt annulment not only cut off its connection to the Barbarian but also severed any links to others. In a particularly grim twist, the result was evident: they found themselves marooned without any means of return, as no connections tethered them to anyone else.
Mari and Makito found themselves alone confronting a formidable trio: the Barbarian, the Inquisitor, and the enigmatic figure atop the pyramid. Alone and outnumbered, their predicament was far from reassuring.
Meanwhile, having teleported to an enigmatic and unfamiliar location, Arek, Sopi, Rin, and Bay now stood isolated and disconnected, devoid of any ties that could facilitate their return.
Stranded without the means of teleporting back, their situation appeared increasingly dire. Arek held onto the hope that Rin or Bay might possess some answers that could guide them forward.
Arek [talk]: "Rin, any idea where we are?"
Rin [talk]: "The ambient mana feels completely foreign. This is nowhere near home."
As Arek turned his attention to Bay, she was a Knight bearing a crippled upper Dantian and an absence of Chakra. As a dedicated body refiner, Bay possessed an impressive reservoir of Ki, which certainly explained why she had easily dominated both Makito and Rin in their previous clashes. Her middle Dantian held some spells Arek recognized, and others he had never seen.
Arek [talk]: “Bay, where are we?”
Bay [talk]: “We are extremely far, further than anybody has ventured. How did we get here?”
Arek [talk]: “Sopi here shot one a his hair in the wind a while back, we just teleported to it”
Bay [talk]: “We are in the wilderness, we need to teleport back”
Arek [talk]: “We can’t, no-one is connected. We are lost”
Bay [talk]: “Forget getting back, even if we knew the direction, it is too far and there will be an ocean to cross. We lived on a island”
Rin [talk]: “Why did you bring us here?”
Arek [talk]: “I made a mistake, one that cannot be corrected”
Bay [talk]: “You need to kill yourself”
Rin [talk]: “Why do you hate him is much?”
Bay [talk]: “We are lost with no hope to return, if some intelligent beast captures him, it could spell the end for all humanity” 

Bay stood perfectly still, her gaze so intense that it could have scorched the ground beneath them. If glares could kill, Arek would have met his demise long ago.
[talk] Bay: “How did you manage to activate my teleport and disrupt my Ki?”
Arek: "Why are you so desperate to have me painted?"
[talk] Bay: “I don't want your death, Arek. I want humanity to thrive. You possess advanced knowledge of physics, and if another entity gains access to your mind, they could exploit our technology. For the greater good, you should kill yourself.”
[talk] Arek: “And what about you? You're a sientist too.”
[talk] Bay: “My upper Dantian is damaged, rendering my mind impenetrable and uncontrollable, unlike yours. Still, I’ll kill myself once you’re gone to ensure I'm no threat. Now, back to my question."”
[talk] Arek: “Fine, since your life is in my hands, I'll tell you the truth. I did activate your teleport spell.”
Bay had never heard of the ability to activate others' spells, but she accepted it as a fact, given her firsthand experience.
[talk] Arek: "Describe this planet to me using Source Earth terms."
[talk] Bay: "Its gravitational pull mirrors Earth's, and we can breathe its air. A singular sun traces a continuous circle in the sky, a result of the planet’s unique rotation. It's unlike anything on Source Earth, though the phenomenon does remind me slightly of Uranus in Source Earth's solar system."
Arek: "However, Uranus's pole only momentarily faced the sun, and its axis frequently shifted. This planet must share that quality."
Bay: "Not quite. Here, the sun’s circular path has remained consistent due to the planet's rotation and its cycle, a KiloChron, approximates a 24-hour day. Rich ambient Mana can be found at the pole opposite the star—the mana pole—and is absent near the barren pole. Given the ambient Mana, We must be in the mana tropic region."
[think] Arek: “If the planet is stable, there has to be a counter gravitational force present in opposition to the star, probably some other planet on a similar orbit but further away.  But hundreds of years is not necessarily a long time either in a cosmic scale.”
Arek: "How come you're so knowledgeable?"
Bay: "I'm a spy, with more years behind me than you might think. My unique condition makes me immune to psionics and information extraction. No one, barring the Pope and Buddha, has as much knowledge about this world. I'm the guardian of the techomancers."
[talk] Arek: "Why don't humans settle in the barren hemisphere? The winds are weak there?"
[talk] Bay: "True, the winds are non-existent, but radiation levels are lethal. With no Mana, there's no Ki body, stripping us of our protective shield against these radiations. In addition, the  unstable crust leads to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, making underground living impossible."
[talk] Arek: "What about the ocean?"
[talk] Bay: “The ocean absorbs mana, resulting in both wind and Mana virtually non-existent just above its surface. But venturing below its depths is rich in Mana and perilous. Even the coastlines can be treacherous because of the unpredictable creatures lurking below.”
[talk] Arek: "Earlier, you mentioned we were on an island. Can you elaborate on that and the school we attended?"
[talk] Bay: "So you can arm yourself with more knowledge, potentially compromising us if either of  your minds gets infiltrated? Loose lips have caused many a catastrophe."
[talk] Rin, who had been attempting to follow their discussion, was largely lost. The intricacies of their conversation were beyond her.
[talk] Arek: "Need I remind you, your life hangs in the balance by my discretion?"
[talk] Bay: "Be clear on one thing: my mind is unreadable. If I'm ever cornered into revealing sensitive information, I won’t hesitate to kill myself. Your threats mean little when my only other option is to be killed by you. Meanwhile, your choices are varied: kill yourself, let me kill you, become prey to some creature, or be mind-controlled to humanity's downfall. Quite the diverse future, don’t you think?"
[talk] Arek was taken aback. He had tried to corner Bay with a threat, only for her to retort with an even starker one, all while using a touch of sarcastic humor. He recalled their school days, where Bay would masterfully turn debates in her favor, always a step ahead of her counterparts.

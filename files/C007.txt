CHAPTER 6 - MINOTAUR

Meanwhile, the priest connected with the man on the road to perform a confession and Arek was able to see inside them both.
[think] Arek: "My power can extend through others"
That man was actually a realm above the Beastmaster but its planets were different, they felt more similar to the beast pulling the carriage than to the humans he had connected with.
[think] Arek: "He is not human!"
Arek opened the door and rushed out of the carriage only to see the man grabbing the Priest by the throat. The 2 closest guards attacked the creature with their swords and 4 guards charged with their wolves while the 2 other ones were shooting at him. Arek was surprised only 2 used their guns, a sword could not compare to the kinetic damage from a bullet.
He then noticed the bullets seemed stopped by an invisible force and just fell to the ground without even bouncing off as soon as they touched the Minotaur. The guards seemed unfazed and kept shooting at him slowly, carefully aiming.
The two swords landed repeated strikes and although they made contact, they didn't seem to do any real damage. The Beastmaster freed the Ankylosaurus that roared and rushed towards the stranger. In return, that person roared back and grew in size, becoming hairy with horns on its head, Arek could not help to think about the Greek mythological creature called a Minotaur.
The Ankylosaurus’ sun became active and sent Charka into its tail which struck the Minotaur for little damage, but it tagged its target. Now Arek was connected to the Minotaur from two sources.
[think] Arek: "Should I help? I could activate some of its spells randomly…"
As Alek was think about what he could do, the Minotaur disappeared with the Priest to reappear on top of the carriage behind the driver, grabbing him by the back of his neck. It was now holding the Priest in one hand and the Beastmaster in the other. When the priest was teleported, Arek lost his connection to the priest but was still connected to the Minotaur through the Ankylosaurus.
A shriek came from above and some small flying animal came shooting down at incredible speed while the guards on the wolves were charging towards the chariot. Suddenly, the gravity increased greatly and Arek found himself flattened to the ground while the knights fell off their wolves and the bird-like creature crashed not far from him.
As one of the Knights fired his gun, the trajectory of the bullet was suddenly altered by a gravitational force, causing it to strike Arek directly in the chest. The impact sent him reeling, and he was consumed by a sudden fear that he might not survive. In addition to being shot, the gravity had pinned him down and he had difficulty move. Despite feeling no immediate pain, he knew he had been injured and he gazed down to see a the bullet wound in his chest, which had pierced his flesh and left him bleeding heavily.  
[think] Arek: "Am I going to die?”

Arek felt no pain, but he wasn’t surprised as he read that grave injuries sometimes give no pain. But death was not coming and to his surprise, he watched as his body quickly sprang into action, the wound healing rapidly before his very eyes. The blood coagulated and filled the hole, and he could see his body reconstructing itself from the inside out. Although he was still unable to move, he felt relief wash over him as he realized his injury wasn't debilitating him in any way.
Seeing that he was fine, he shifted his attention to analyzing the battle and if he needed to help.
The Minotaur had used a planet to Teleport to the top of the carriage; it was an advanced version of Escape that allowed it to teleport a set distance in the direction it looked. It then activated another planet to increase the gravity in its surroundings. A current traveling from its Upper Dantian through its grip seemed to prevent the Priest and Beastmaster from activating any of their planets. 
The two guards kept shooting, not worried if they might hit the captured humans but the Ankylosaurus stayed away for now. Besides the bird, nobody seemed affected much by the gravity except for Arek.
[talk] Minotaur: "You will all die, weak humans"
[mind] Arek: "I need to do something"
Arek could only identify spells he had already seen in use and he noticed minotaur had a planet with the teleport spell ready to cast.
[mind] Arek: "This should work"
[shout] Arek: “Hey man-cow, are you as stupid as you are ugly?”
The minotaur looked down at Arek from the top of the carriage and then disappeared, replaced by an earth statue in its semblance. The statue broke and the driver dropped on the roof of the carriage while the Priest fell to the side.

[talk] Priest Reman: "What happened?"
[talk] BeastMaster: "We need to get out of here fast!"
The Priest swiftly grabbed Arek and rushed into the carriage as the driver quickly hitched the Ankylosaurus and set it off at a galloping pace.
[talk] Arek: "I felt like a sitting duck. How could it be so much stronger than all of us combined?"
[talk] Priest: “It was a Lord and higher realms grant access to greater powers, but also come with greater luck and strength."
[talk] Arek: "Luck?"
[talk] Priest: "If you were to flip a coin against a mortal as a Cultivator, you would win most of the time. But against a Lord, you would almost never win."
[talk] Arek: "Now I understand how it managed to grab you two so quickly."
The carriage driver, who had remained silent until now, opened a small window to address the group.
[talk] BeastMaster: "He easily grabbed the Priest, but he had to use cunning to capture me."
This remark seemed to upset the Priest, who promptly shut the window.
[talk] Arek: "Thank you for closing the window. He was speaking nonsense. Why would a Cultivator resort to trickery to catch someone?"
[talk] Priest Reman: "Don't judge a Cultivator based on appearances. Although he can be irritating, he's a Sage and I'm just a Knight. He was the only real threat to the Minotaur."
[think] Arek: “It seems I can identify a Cultivator's realm when I make a connection.”
[talk] Arek: "The guards hit the Minotaur repeatedly, both up close and from a distance, but it seemed unfazed. Was it invulnerable? Even technology didn't seem to affect it, but you said technology could kill deities."
[talk] Priest Reman: "Some of the knights were using guns, a type of technology that shoots projectiles at high speeds. The creature was protected by multiple layers of shields that could absorb an unlimited amount of damage for a short time, before collapsing. The knights were shooting to destroy the shields, one by one. The swords of the other knights, the fangs of the wolves, and the tail of the Arosur could all penetrate the shields, but each shield would reduce the amount of Ki transferred with each strike. With enough shields destroyed by gunfire, they could have sent enough Ki to inflicted real harm."
[talk] Arek: "Are all beasts protected in this way?"
[talk] Priest Reman: "Not just beasts, all Ki bodies."
[talk] Arek: "So, all living beings are protected like this except mortals?"
[talk] Priest Reman: "Yes, and most plants too."
[talk] Arek: "Even the moss on the ground is shielded?"
[talk] Priest Reman: "Of course. It protects the ground, which is why most of our structures are covered in it."
[talk] Arek: "So technology can't hurt beasts because of their shields?"
[talk] Priest Reman: "The power of technology can cause immense damage and even kill a deity, but only after its shields have been depleted."
The Priest fell silent for a moment, deep in thought. Then, he opened the window to speak to the Beastmaster.
[think] Priest Reman: "Beastmaster, I entrust these two to your care."

Without waiting for a response, the Priest disappeared and the driver came into the carriage
[talk] Mari: “Where's the Priest?”
[talk] Beastmaster: “The Priest has been summoned by the Church.”
[talk] Mari: “What happened to the Minotaur?”
[talk] Beastmaster: “It wasn't petrified, it teleported underground, switching places with the rocks. The connection to it was severed, but I don't know what happened after that.”
[talk] Mari: “Isn't it impossible to teleport someone against their will?”
[talk] Beastmaster: “It's possible if the summoner is three realms higher than the target, but a Lord like the Minotaur couldn't have been summoned against its will. It must have been summoned by an ally underground.”
Arek knew the truth. He had activated a Minotaur's spell, causing it to go teleport in the direction it was looking, which happened to be underground, switching places with the dirt was there. The Minotaur had activated the teleportation on its own, so no consent was needed.
[talk] Alek: “What spell did it use to teleport on top of the carriage?”
[talk] Beastmaster: “It looked like 'Dash', teleporting a fixed distance in a specific direction.”
[talk] Mari: “I didn't think you got hit that many times to lose your shield, Alek.”
[talk] Beastmaster: “He was only shot once and has no shield.”
[talk] Mari: “Everyone has shields.”
[talk] Beastmaster: “His middle Dantian is crippled, so not only does he not have shields, he can't use mana or cast spells, he can’t even see using Mana or absorb cores.”
[talk] Mari: “He can’t cast spells?”
[talk] Beastmaster”: His Upper Dantian is very powerful and his Lower Dantian is average, but absorbing cores will be impossible, he will never perform magic” 
[think] Arek: "Even though the lack of a shield is a hindrance, I can still cast spells from other people and creatures."
[talk] Mari: “Arek, can you see the world around you with your eyes closed?”
[talk] Arek: “How could I see the world with my eye closed”
[talk] Mari: “Just try!”
Arek closed his eyes
[talk] Mari: “Focus, can you see anything?”
Arek opened his eyes
[talk] Arek: “I could not”
[talk] Mari: “Your middle Dantian is crippled”
[talk] Mari: “Why am I fine after I was shot through the thorax?”
[Talk] Mari: "Do you realize what's wrong with you right now?"
[Talk] Arek: "I don't care about not having magic. I'm just amazed at how quickly my wound is closing. Am I really healing?”
[Talk] Mari: "Your Ki body has the ability to regenerate, a wound like this is nothing.”
As Arek processed this information, he couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and amazement at the power of his own body. He marveled at the idea that he could heal from even the most serious of injuries. For the first time, he truly understood why they referred to themselves as immortals.
[Talk] Arek: "I understand now why we call ourselves immortals.” Breathing a sigh of relief
[Talk] Mari: "Indeed, but don't forget that without shields, you can still be vaporized in an instant. And you have no shields.”

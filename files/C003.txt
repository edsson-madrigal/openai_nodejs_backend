CHAPTER 2 - AWAKENED

[talk] Bay: "Salvation shall come from above!” She exclaimed
Arek was panicking and didn't even listen to Bay as he was fixating on the creature whose body now filled the entire space of the corridor. Arek remembered the mythical creatures of Source Earth and giant rats were never portrayed as friendly.
[talk] Arek: "We're going to die!” He lamented
[talk] Bay: "Look Up!” She ordered
He looked up as ordered and saw a hole in the ceiling wide enough for him to go through. It seemed to be a vertical passage with red lights illuminating the way.
[talk] Bay: "Up you go!"
Without hesitation, Bay threw Arek up the hole with ease, her strength and speed were extraordinary. Arek flew up the hole and grabbed a ladder along the way instinctively.
[talk] Bay: "What's wrong?” She asked calmly, as if their current predicament was just another day.
Arek looked down at Bay, her cool demeanor never faltering as she had found an escape route. The shadow of the creature was quickly approaching, but there was still time for her to join him. After securing himself on the ladder, Arek reached out his hand towards Bay, his voice filled with concern and urgency.
[talk] Arek: "Come on!”
But Bay did not reach out for his hand, instead, she focused her gaze on the approaching rat.
[talk] Bay: "Don't worry about me, you don’t have much time, just go!" She replied calmly, her voice steady and reassuring.
[talk] Arek: "I'm not leaving you here!" He insisted, not willing to abandon her in the face of danger.
[talk] Bay: "Don't waste my sacrifice. Go, and live." She said firmly, determination etched on her face.
[talk] Arek: "Bay, no!” He shouted, tears streaming down his face as he watched her run towards the creature, determined to sacrifice herself for his survival.
[shout] Bay: "Live and smile!” She yelled, her voice filled with conviction as she faced the creature head on.
[talk] Arek: "Bay!” He screamed, tears streaming down his face as he watched her disappear from his sight.
[shout] Bay: "Go!"
This last order from her seemed to trigger a reaction in Arek and he started climbing the ladder as fast as possible. As Arek made his way up the ladder, he couldn't help but wonder how Bay was managing to fight the giant rat barehanded. The sounds of the creature's screeches echoed in his ears.
[think] Arek: "How is Bay able to fight this monstrous creature butt naked?”
He finally reached the top and struggled to open the heavy ceiling door. Suddenly, an explosion occurred and a surge of hot air and fire rushed out from below, propelling the door open and sending Arek flying. Miraculously, he landed without injury as a large plume of fire erupted from the passage he had just escaped. As he got up and ran away as fast as he could, he couldn't shake off the image of Bay's bravery and sacrifice. She had remained calm in the face of death and had saved his life with her quick thinking.
[think] Arek: "I will never again let fear control me. I will always remember Bay's sacrifice and her strength."


He opened his eyes and was immediately struck his surroundings. Towering pillars, that seemed to stretch up to the heavens, held an endless array of lights in their leaves, illuminating the lush greenery that covered the land.
[think] Arek: "These pillars, are they giant trees? And that can't be the sky, it must be some kind of artificial canopy with lights beneath.”
He was outside, lying on a bed of moss, a familiar living plant, yet he had never seen anything like this before, in art or in reality. But before he could fully take in his surroundings, a searing pain overtook him and everything went black.
Exhausted and out of energy to move further, with tears streaming down his face, Arek smiled and closed his eyes, trying to make sense of everything that had happened and decide on a course of action.
They were the children of humanity, the hope for the future of the human race.  Each child was given a unique name, and his was Arekis. He was 12 and used goggles that allowed him to see a world that was not real, that he could shape to his liking. With these goggles, he could see others as they wanted to be seen, or he could change their appearance. He chose to make them all look like identical mannequins, with the exception of Bay. He only altered her nose and clothing, naively believing the person that she wanted him to see was her actual self.
Arek had no memories from his early years, whether he was a survivor of the cataclysm that befell Source Earth, or a descendant of one of the survivors, he had no way to know. He knew nothing of the world he lived in besides that it was small and dark. Through records of Source Earth such as Wikipedia, Arek was able to learn about the state of humanity during those times and the dangers it faced.
He had no memories from his early years, and was uncertain if he was a survivor of the cataclysm that befell Source Earth or a descendant of one of the survivors. All he knew about the world he lived in was that it was small and dark.
Through records of Source Earth such as Wikipedia, Arek was able to learn about the state of humanity during those times and the dangers it faced.
The appearance of the giant rat raised questions in Arek's mind. For a rat to be this size, it would need a suitable environment with an abundance of food and water, similar to that required by humans. How could a rat thrive to the point of becoming giant while humanity perished? Could this rat be man-made, created through genetic engineering? And what about Bay's speed and strength, was she genetically enhanced as well? Arek couldn't help but wonder if they were all products of genetic engineering.


Arek was trapped in a state of consciousness that was neither asleep nor awake. The pain he felt was not physical, but a mental anguish that impaired his ability to reason and fight back. Suddenly, Bay's face came to his mind and he focused on her smile. Gradually, his rational mind returned and he began to push back against the mental assault until the pain dissipated.
When Arek opened his eyes, he found himself standing in a circular room with three evenly spaced doors. A voice, without a visible source, spoke out to him, "Choose a path." He knew he was in a dream, as the room had no temperature and he couldn't feel his body.
[Think] Arek: "I must be dreaming that I passed out after being chased by a giant rat and almost burned alive. This is a dream within a dream."
The voice spoke again, "Choose a path." Each door had a symbol on it that he had never seen, but in this dream, he knew what they meant.
[Think] Arek: "Body, Mind, and Magic. I don’t care for magic which means nothing, my brain is what is most valuable”
Arek stepped through the door with the 'Mind' symbol on it, ready to explore the depths of his own memories. As he opened the door, everything around him disappeared, and memories began to flood his mind. Though he recognized most of the subjects, he didn't have time to fully analyze them.
[Think] Arek: "This dream is making me feel like all of these memories, even scientific papers and formulas, are genuine. But I know that if I were to analyze them, they would likely be nothing more than gibberish."
Despite the questionable authenticity of the memories, Arek couldn't help but marvel at the power of his own mind. He remembered learning to talk, read, count and compute, and even his earliest memory of waking up at the school at the age of 5. But the memories didn't stop there, they delved even further back into the darkness, and he felt as though information was being fed to him.
[Think] Arek: "Could I have truly been created in a laboratory? But, this is just a dream, these memories hold no truth, they mean nothing.”


Arek awoke to find himself enveloped in complete darkness. As he lay there, he noticed that the mattress and the air felt unfamiliar and began to suspect that he was still in a dream.
[think] Arek: "Am I dreaming that I am waking up? That would make sense since I was dreaming within a dream.”
[talk] Arek: "Is anyone here?" he called out
A young girl entered the room, holding a lantern that illuminated the primitive surroundings. She was dressed in clothing that matched the setting. Arek felt an immediate attraction towards her, which was unexpected. She appeared to be around his age, but was a little taller, with beautiful purple eyes and dark black hair. He had never felt this way towards anyone before, and it was a wonderful feeling.
[think] Arek: "I do not want to wake up! I must play along otherwise the dream could end"
[talk] Purple Eyed Girl: "How do you feel, little brother?" 
The term of endearment she used made Arek realize that he must have been ill for her to ask him this question.
[talk] Arek: "I feel much better. Has anything happened while I was ill?"
[talk] Purple Eyed Girl: "You weren't ill, you've Awakened, but something terrible happened and many people died"
[talk] Arek: "What happened?"
[talk] Purple Eyed Girl: "Our village was brutally attacked by monstrous creatures. Makito, who was studying at the Academy, was safe but everyone else, including my family and friends, were not as lucky. I was able to survive as I was by your side, caring for you in the safety of the church, but our village is no more."
[talk] Arek: "Everyone?"
[talk] Purple Eyed Girl: "Yes, Dad, Mom, Karin, Reberik, everyone..."
[think] Arek: "I went through a breakthrough and awakened? What village? Who are these people? I need to guide this dream to get more information"
[talk] Arek: "I can't remember anything specific, it's like my memories are all gone. For example, I recognize you, but I don't remember your name or brother, I don’t even remember my name."
The girl's face became serious as she asked him about the door he had opened.
[talk] Purple Eyed Girl: "What door did you open?"
[talk] Arek: "I opened the door to the Mind"
[talk] Purple Eyed Girl: "The Spirit Door? Opening that door first is dangerous! My name is Mari and your name is Arek. I hope you are not crippled, give me your hand and look at me."
Arek was relieved that his name wasn't Arekis and put his hand forward, which Mari grabbed firmly.

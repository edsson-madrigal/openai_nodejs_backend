Chapter 13 - WIND

[talk] Arek: “What are we going to do now?”
[talk] Mari: “I will practice my escape spell.”
[talk] Makito: “I will go into virtuality and train.”
[talk] Arek: “You shouldn't leave; Rin said it was dangerous and told us to wait for her.”
[talk] Makito: “I don’t need to leave; I have a virtuality chamber in my room.”
[talk] Arek: “What am I going to do then?”
[talk] Mari: “You have some credits; why don't you use your assistant to shop? They will deliver.”
[talk] Makito: “You should tame your Supar, Sopi. Since you have no magic and your shields are through it, it should be your priority.”
[talk] Mari: “Whatever you do, don't bother me. I'm going into seclusion and hope to break into the Devil realm with this training.”
[talk] Makito: “If you need me, don't try to open my chamber or even touch it. Contact me through the assistant and leave a message if I'm not available. I'll get back to you.”
Arek had earned some credits from training with Rin and multiplied them by winning in Tabot. Now he was curious to see what he could purchase. He had gained some understanding of Stun and Charm in recent days and wanted to master them. He browsed the available items to help master psionic powers, but aside from the expensive Arcane Insight Crystals, he realized his power to see energy, combined with practice, was better than other methods for sale. After his experience with Rin, he also found Charm too dangerous to practice, although he could easily practice Stun with Sopi.
There were many basic equipment, armor, and weapons he could buy, but he wouldn't dare decide without Makito's advice. He didn't have enough credits for a virtuality chamber, so learning body abilities was out of the question.
He was about to give up when he found a set of Sensory Imprint Crystals from a Beast Master. These crystals recorded experiences through all the senses for others to experience. They were relatively easy to produce and could be replicated, making them affordable. This particular set of crystals recorded a Beastmaster taming a new familiar, and it was a Supar, just like Sopi!
Remembering Makito's advice, Arek decided to purchase the crystals and use his time at home to train Sopi. He was filled with determination and excitement at the prospect of bonding with his unique Supar.

The bond between Arek and his Supar, Sopi, deepened with each passing day. After experiencing the training methods of a Beastmaster through Sensory Imprint Crystals, Arek gained an understanding of how psionics were used to read emotions and deduce a beast's desires. The Beastmaster had used his psionic powers to read the Supar's mind and even possess it momentarily. Arek couldn't do the same, but his unique ability to see energies with unprecedented clarity allowed him to believe that he could go even further in taming Sopi.
He placed Sopi in front of him in his room. The intelligent creature hadn't tried to escape or cast any spells on its own. It seemed to recognize its powerlessness before Arek. Was it possible that Arek's powers could be used to communicate with Sopi?
The Supar's vision was unlike that of humans. The world appeared in red and white through Mana. Red represented Ki, with different shades for different levels of energy. Makito was a denser red than Mari, indicative of his greater Ki. White shapes, faint and transparent, represented walls without moss, dead matter, mortals, or technology. While some cultivators could see the world in a similar way, Sopi's vision was its only sense and was thus far more developed.
Using his psionic powers and his unique insight into Sopi's vision, Arek found he could project a simple shape within Sopi's sight. Their first lesson was communication. After designing a shape for tagging a target, Arek would project that shape onto the target, and then make shoot one of its hairs to tag it.
In time, Sopi began to shoot at the targets on its own. Even more astonishingly, it started projecting a similar shape for Arek to see, suggesting targets to be tagged. This laid the foundation for a complex dialogue between Arek and Sopi.
As they were restricted to their home, Arek allowed Sopi to go out and explore beyond the city. The Supar could phase itself to be almost undetectable and would shoot and teleport from place to place. Its only limitation was that it lost all its tags every time it teleported. Thanks to its permanent connection to Arek, In case of danger, it could always teleport back to him. Sopi had become the perfect scout, especially for someone like Arek who could see through its eyes.
Through tagging various creatures outside the city limits, and even some humans, Arek learned to harness their mana senses just as he did with Sopi. Every tagged being, oblivious to this bond, served as another set of eyes for Arek. However, this link would be severed when Sopi teleported.

Arek's curiosity about the world around him was insatiable, fueled by the unnatural environment he found himself in. The artificial light of the trees illuminated his surroundings, yet the sky remained a hidden enigma. Though Sopi's mana vision did not have the reach  to perceive the sky, Arek knew that there had to be a place where he could glimpse the  heavens. He sent Sopi out once more, this time with a directive to ascend to the canopy's summit.
As soon as Sopi teleported to the peak, it was met with a furious force that dragged it into the maelstrom of a hurricane, teeming with lethal debris. Without its protective shields, Sopi would have been obliterated in an instant. But Arek teleported it back before the shields failed.
A barrier of wind so impenetrable and relentless that it defied approach? The strangeness of this planet seemed to grow with each discovery, and Arek's exploration only gave rise to more questions.
Undeterred, he made a second attempt, directing Sopi to explore in the opposite direction. This time, he was cautious to avoid teleporting Sopi to the extreme top, instead positioning it at a distance where it could observe the canopy without getting caught in the violent winds. Above the trees, a mysterious force that was repelling the fierce winds. That rejection power provided an explanation for Sopi's previous ordeal.
In two separate directions from the city, Sopi encountered the same powerful winds. But Arek's determination to understand didn't waver. He devised a plan, capitalizing on Sopi's resilience and its ability to teleport back to him in perilous situations. 
Sopi shot a hair into the raging wind and phased into hiding, a seemingly small action. Arek's hope was anchored in patience; he believed that the hair would eventually find its way beyond the barrier of wind.
Sopi phased in hiding and the wait began, the longer they waited, the further the hair could travel. Arek's hope was that the hair would eventually find its way beyond the barrier of wind.

Arek found himself with no more credits for shopping and an Assistant lacking in useful information. Meanwhile, his familiar Sopi was perched silently in the trees, waiting, while his siblings Mari and Makito were occupied in their pursuits, secluded in meditation and engrossed in virtuality.
Arek decided to tackle a new challenge: mastering the art of Stun through his connection with Sopi. Though Sopi was physically static in its hiding place, it remained psychically connected to Arek, allowing him to tap into its stunning ability.
Despite his special power to see energies, which offered a rare insight into the stunning effect, the process was far from smooth. Arek repeatedly experienced the sensation of being stunned and then meditated on the experience, hoping to unlock its secrets. However, the progress was painfully slow, and frustration began to mount. He had expected his unique ability to provide an advantage, but the art of Stun was proving to be more elusive than he anticipated.
Arek's frustration with his slow progress in learning to Stun was abruptly replaced by alarm when Rin arrived with a chilling warning. Her face was tight with anxiety, her words clipped and urgent.

[talk] Rin: “Get your brother and sister; you need to leave.”
[talk] Arek: “Leave where?”
[talk] Rin: “Anywhere. Leave Borutenik, immediately.”
[talk] Arek: “What happened?”
[talk] Rin: “Instead of helping, my family summoned me to our estate, with very clear instructions not to contact you. This is why I came to warn you without my assistant.”
[talk] Arek: “You do love me.”
[talk] Rin: “I owed you. We are now even. I need to go.”
With that, she left without turning back, leaving Arek to wrestle with her words and the urgency in her voice. Time was of the essence.
He knocked on Mari's door with no response and then tried to contact Mari and Makito through his assistant, also without success. As worry began to gnaw at him, Makito emerged from his room.
After removing his assistant and explaining Rin's warning, Makito's face turned ashen, and he began to hammer on Mari’s door with a force that threatened to break it down. The loud banging resonated through the house, mirroring the pounding of Arek's heart who put back his assistant to try reaching Mari through it.
Finally, Mari appeared, her face flushed with fury and her eyes ablaze.
[talk] Mari: “I was so close to enlightenment; this had better be important!”
[talk] Unknown person: “Kneel!”

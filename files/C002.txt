CHAPTER 1 - SCHOOL

Laying naked without any sheets, half imbedded into a mattress, Arek woke up in total darkness. He waved his hand and the lights slowly turned on, accompanied by gentle music. His room was small, the head of the mattress against a wall with a door on each side, and the wall opposite seemed to be made of opaque black glass. Besides the mattress, the room had nothing: no objects or piece f clothing.
Arek was a thirteen-year-old boy, small for his age, easily passing for someone younger, with hair as white as snow and eyes the color of a deep, rich ruby. He walked through one of the doors into a small cylindrical room, where a liquid substance was sprayed onto him and mechanical arms tended to a few areas, including inside his mouth, while he relieved himself. This was his shower, bathroom, toilette; his corporal needs room. Once clean, intense light dried him while the mechanical arm placed goggles on his face.
Arek walked back to his room to find a breathtaking scenery through the now transparent glass wall. He was located high in the mountains, and the rising sun showed it was early morning. Upon leaving the room through the other door, Arek found himself on a street with flowery small housing similar to his own on both sides and imposing mountain tops beyond. Everything was impeccably maintained with a variety of birds chirping beautifully, it was perfect.
[talk] Girl: "Hi Arekis!"
[talk] Arek: "Hi Bay. I prefer if you called me Arek"
[talk] Girl: "You’re not supposed to change your name!"
From the tone of their voices, it seemed that Bay was excited to see Arek, but Arek was not as enthusiastic. When Arek turned around to look at her, he saw a young girl around his age with green eyes, freckles, messy red hair and a pig-like nose. She was wearing a dress so dirty that its original color could not be determined. Despite her appearance, Arek couldn't help but smile as flies started to orbit around her.
[talk] Arek: "Your dress is pretty.”
Seeing him smile while looking at her, Bay furrowed her eyebrows in confusion.
[talk] Bay: "What are you doing? What color is my dress?"
[think] Arek: "Easy, it's always pink."
[talk] Arek: "It's pink, your favorite color, and now butterflies are dancing around you."
[talk] Bay: "I want to see the butterflies, share them with me."
[talk] Arek: "No."
[talk] Bay: "Do you want to see my world?"
[talk] Arek: "No"
[talk] Bay: "Should we break the proximity rule?" Her voice tinged with excitement.
[talk] Arek: "No,
[talk] Bay: "But you find me pretty"
[talk] Arek: "No"
[talk] Bay: “No? But you said I was pretty" Her disappointment clear in her voice.
[talk] Arek: "I said your dress was pretty, not you.” He clarified.
[talk] Bay: "Then why the butterflies?" She Tilted her head to the side.
[talk] Arek: "To counter your appearance.” He was unable to hide the smile on his face as he looked at her pig nose.
Arek laugh out loud and Bay laughed along with him.
Despite her constant talking and probing, Arek didn't think Bay was a bad person. She was highly intelligent and won a majority of their arguments. She also never took offense to his provocations and seemed to enjoy his company. Arek thought of her as a predator, a fighter excitedly looking for a brawl and he was her most worthy prey. He found her annoying, but he liked and respected her.
As they walked down the street, Arek noticed the other people in the village. They all looked alike with plain faces and gray clothes, only their voices varied and indicated they were distinct individuals. They walked in the same direction, avoiding coming too close to Arek or Bay. Upon arriving at the end of the street which met another perpendicular street, all would briefly look at a digital sign on the wall and head off.
[talk] Bay: "Look at Ara! Her dress is so colorful and beautiful! I'm going to dress you like Lee, it will fit you so much better than him.” She commented non-stop on almost everybody.
Arek completely ignored her and looked at the sign
[written] Sign: "Room 42.” Arek read the sign silently
[talk] Bay: "Room 42.” She read out-loud.
[talk] Arek: "Did you hack me?" His voice was laced with suspicion.
Bay looked at Arek's surprised face and immediately understood the situation.
[talk] Bay: "Are you impressed with my hacking abilities?" A sly grin was on her face.
[talk] Arek: "Why did you take such a risk? How did you do it?"
Bay suddenly dropped to her knees, blocking Arek's path with a panicked look on her face.
[talk] Bay: "Please don't report me!"
[talk] Arek: "I would be surprised if they don't already know.” His mind was racing with the implications of Bay's hacking
Bay started laughing as she got up.
[talk] Bay: "We have the same room, imbecile.” She shacked her head.
It took Arek a few seconds to process what Bay just said and he let out a sigh of relief. Education was paired, everyday all the students would come to this sign at the end of the road to see what room they would study in and there would always be 2 students per room. Today, they saw the same number because they had been paired.
[talk] Arek: "My assumption was indeed stupid," Arek said, not caring about his face and eager to admit his wrongs. His passion was learning and only through recognizing mistakes could understanding improve. They walked together into Room 42, the room was the same size as his bedroom with 2 chairs facing a giant whiteboard on the wall.
[talk] Arek: "Room 42... Ready to learn the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?” A hint of sarcasm in his tone
[talk] Bay: "Not without knowing the question"
Arek smiled, he didn't understand how he could dislike and like Bay so much at the same time. With a hand gesture, the flies stopped flying around her.
[talk] Teacher: "Welcome to MIT's Atomic Theory and Atomic Structure Course," a person said, appearing in front of them as a hologram. Animations came on the whiteboard while the side of the board showed the title 'Wikipedia' above it and the Wikipedia page for Pauli Exclusion principle under it.
[talk] Bay: "Boooring," Bay said, her disinterest clear in her voice.
The teacher didn't react and continued the lesson as if Bay hadn't talked. This was a lecture recorded a long long time ago at a university on Source Earth. The only living beings in the room were Arek and Bay.
[talk] Arek: "I wonder what happened to Source Earth," Arek said, his voice filled with curiosity. As soon as their eyes left the teacher, the lesson paused.
[talk] Bay: "To what?" Bay asked, her eyes curious.
[talk] Arek: "To Source Earth. We are taught no knowledge from after their year 2038, we don't even know how long ago that was"
[talk] Bay: "The only thing we need to know right now is that Source Earth no longer exists, we are the last of the human species"
[talk] Arek: "How were we saved? From what? What is this dark world we live in?"
[talk] Bay: "Maybe we are underground on a planet without an atmosphere?" She suggested
[talk] Arek: "A planet with a gravity close to Source Earth? I think a spaceship with artificial gravity is a more plausible theory.” He countered
[talk] Bay: "How do you know the gravity is similar? Unit references could have been modified to make it appear that way."
[talk] Arek: "Units haven't been modified, Wikipedia has numerous references to our body and physics that can be used to verify the units are correct and the gravity is similar."
[talk] Bay: "Imagine moving through the stars, searching for a new home. It's exciting!” sh went along with Arek’s theory
[talk] Arek: "It's just a theory, we'll know the truth when we graduate."
[talk] Bay: "Or when we arrive... ¦"
[talk] Arek: "Why don't we have parents? Are we genetically engineered?"
[talk] Bay: "Let's get back to the lecture before we're here all day."
The teacher had frozen while they were discussing, but as soon as they both looked back towards the teacher, the lesson resumed.
Suddenly, an explosion was heard and the world around them shook. They removed their goggles and were met with the same darkness.
[talk] Bay: "I was worried something had happened, but nothing changed, the world is still as black as it used to be.” Her voice remained calm as if nothing had happened.
[talk] Arek: "Something is wrong with the spaceship!" He exclaimed, his voice filled with concern.
[talk] Bay: "Says your imagination. I don't know we’re not on a dark exploding planet!"
[talk] Arek: "Are you not worried?"
[talk] Bay: "Sorry, would you prefer for me to cry or scream?” She responded in a playful tone
Small red lights on the wall pierced the darkness and the door to the room opened revealing more red lights outside. Air started flowing in and Arek started to feel hot. Having lived all his life in a world always at the same temperature and without a breeze, these were new feelings that were uncomfortable for him.
[talk] Bay: "What a small hairless penis you have there..." Her voice was filled with amusement and without care.
Arek turned around furious but froze when he saw Bay. She was shamelessly standing in front of him naked with a big smile on her face. He would have thought nothing of it if she had been around his age or younger, but even though she was almost as short as him, she was obviously older than him given how much she had developed.
[talk] Bay: "You are probably the only 13 years old taking a particle physics class, I am the one who should be surprised by your age. You little genius."
Their world was in perpetual absolute darkness and the virtual world presented by their goggles did not have to represent the actual features of their true body. From her voice, he knew she was a girl but assumed they were the same age. 
Bay closed her eyes and opened her arms, as if trying to sense her surroundings, her brows furrowed into a frown.



[talk] Bay: "Let's go for a run."
She grabbed his hand and pulled him along, running through the narrow corridor lined with red emergency lights. He struggled to keep up with her speed, but she simply picked him up and carried him without slowing down.
As his head rested against her chest, he couldn't help but feel a sense of comfort and safety. As an orphan like all the other students, he had never had a mother or any woman hold or hug him before. Despite his young age, he felt nothing inappropriate, instead feeling calm and at ease.
[talk] Bay: "Don't get any ideas."
Arek assumed she was joking and chose to ignore her comment as they passed the last naked student running in the same direction. It seemed that no one was ahead of them anymore, with the last classroom far behind them. Bay was an incredibly fast runner, and impressively strong for being able to carry him as if he weighed nothing.
[talk] Arek: "Where are we going?"
[talk] Bay: "Just going with the flow."
[talk] Arek: "I've never come this far before. Do you know what's ahead?”
Screams echoed through the corridor as Arek and Bay ran forward. Suddenly, Bay stopped in her tracks.
[talk] Bay: "Do you know what's behind us?” She asked, her tone holding a hint of amusement.
Arek quickly turned around and saw that the red lights on the ceiling were being obscured by a large, shadowy figure. It was getting closer at a rapid pace.
[talk] Arek: "We need to move, now! Something's chasing us, and it's getting closer fast!" His voice was filled with panic as he urgently looked over his shoulder at the rapidly approaching figure.
But Bay didn't budge, her gaze fixed on the wall ahead of them. Arek noticed that the tunnel ended there.
[talk] Arek: "Is this a dead end?” He asked, his voice tinged with defeat.
[talk] Bay: "A fitting choice of words." She replied coolly, her eyes still scanning the wall.
Arek followed her gaze and saw a small hole in the center of the wall, about a meter off the ground. It was too small for him to fit through though. He turned back towards the figure chasing them and could now clearly see that it was a giant rat, closing in on them at a rapid pace.
[talk] Arek: "A giant rat!” He exclaimed in despair
